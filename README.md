# Intro-of-Probability-in-Python

This repository provides an introductory crash course on **Probability and Statistics using Python**, leveraging Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning. It includes foundational concepts in probability, statistical reasoning, and data analysis using real-world datasets such as **NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)**.
